# Charlie Munger Wisdom 🧠

A comprehensive collection of Charlie Munger's most powerful ideas — mental models, investment principles, and life philosophy from Warren Buffett's legendary partner.

## Who Was Charlie Munger?

Charlie Munger (1924-2023) was Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett's partner for over 60 years. While Buffett is famous for stock picking, Munger is revered for his multidisciplinary thinking approach — the "latticework of mental models" that made him one of the most admired thinkers in investing and beyond.

## Munger's Core Mental Models

### 1. Inversion
**"Invert, always invert."** — Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "How would I certainly fail?" Then avoid those things.

**Applications**:
- Investment: What would destroy this business? If the answers are plausible, don't invest
- Career: What behaviors guarantee career failure? Dishonesty, unreliability, arrogance — avoid them
- Health: What habits definitely damage health? Eliminate those first

### 2. Circle of Competence
**"Knowing what you don't know is more useful than being brilliant."**

Stay within areas where you have genuine expertise. The edges of your circle are more dangerous than being completely outside it — partial knowledge creates overconfidence.

### 3. Second-Order Thinking
Most people think only about the immediate consequences of a decision (first-order). Munger insists on thinking about the consequences of the consequences.

**Example**: Rent control (first-order: lower rents) → reduces housing investment → housing shortage → higher actual costs (second-order)

### 4. The Lollapalooza Effect
When multiple psychological tendencies combine and reinforce each other, the effect is dramatically larger than the sum of parts. Munger identified this as the most powerful force in human misjudgment.

**Example**: Enron combined incentive-caused bias + social proof + authority influence + commitment/consistency = catastrophic fraud

### 5. Opportunity Cost
Every choice has a cost — the best alternative you didn't choose. Munger applies this rigorously:
- "The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily"
- Before any investment, ask: "Is this better than my next best alternative?"

## Munger's 25 Cognitive Biases

From his famous "Psychology of Human Misjudgment" talk:

| # | Bias | Key Insight |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | Reward and Punishment | Incentives drive behavior more than anything else |
| 2 | Liking/Loving | We distort reality to favor people and things we like |
| 3 | Disliking/Hating | We distort reality to disfavor people and things we dislike |
| 4 | Doubt-Avoidance | We rush to decisions to eliminate uncertainty |
| 5 | Inconsistency-Avoidance | We resist changing our minds even with new evidence |
| 6 | Curiosity | One of the few innate tendencies that helps us |
| 7 | Kantian Fairness | We need to feel treated fairly — real or perceived |
| 8 | Envy/Jealousy | "It's not greed that drives the world, but envy" |
| 9 | Reciprocation | We feel compelled to repay favors — and slights |
| 10 | Influence-from-Mere-Association | We judge things by their associations, not their merits |

### Munger's Rules for Life

1. **"Take a simple idea and take it seriously."**
2. **"Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up."**
3. **"The big money is not in the buying and the selling, but in the waiting."**
4. **"There is no better teacher than history in determining the future."**
5. **"Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean."**
